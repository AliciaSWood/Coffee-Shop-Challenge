# Coffee-Shop-Challenge

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Challenge!

Originally, I had planned to break the challenge down into sub/super classes. But 'enums' give us 'final' ie unchangeable variables called 'constants' which could help prevent our prices from being changed accidentally or by malovent persons. Enum constants are accessed with dot notation.
